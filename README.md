## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://makina06.github.io/Product-preview-card-component/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-I learned how to link font-family on my html

-Use varaible for change design elements in one place, rather than having to search for and modify multiple instances of the same value throughout your stylesheet.

-Using rem instead of pixel for my padding margin and font size

-Reset my CSS styles

```


### Continued development

As a future goal, I aim to enhance my CSS skills by utilizing appropriate units for padding, margin, and font size, becoming proficient in the use of CSS grid, and incorporating the use of CSS variables to achieve clean and organized code.

## Acknowledgments
The work of Kevin Powell has inspired me to delve deeper into the creation of CSS variables and through his published resources, particularly on his YouTube channel, I have gained a better understanding of the importance of using a CSS reset.
